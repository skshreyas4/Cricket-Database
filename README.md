# Cricket-Database
The entitled project “CRICKET DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is made keeping in mind all the aspects of the CRICKET. It will be capable of doing all the necessary operations/functions that are done in any Cricket for example-raking of the team, nationality of the players, skills of players, keeping track of team details, won match etc. Since all the work that is to be done by this software can also be done manually, but this consumes time and labour. So this software will be a relief to those who have to do all this work manually. The knowledge of computers and programming has become a basic skill needed to survive in present information based on society.
The motive is to make such kind of software which is very easy to use. There will not be need of any training and the person who does not have much knowledge of computers can also use this. Through this the details of the players that plays for the team can be retrieved if necessary. All the records of the teams will be kept for further enquiries.
